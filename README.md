# GPA CALCULATOR

This repository contains a simple Java program for calculating Grade Point Average (GPA). The program allows users to input their course name and code, course unit, and scores, type and enter the "exit" word to stop the program from taking any more inputs. The program then calculates the GPA, displays the result on the console, and presents the entered courses and values in a tabular form and the GPA result after the table.

# FORMULAR

Quality point = course unit * grade unit 
GPA = total quality point / total grade unit
