# GPA CALCULATOR

This repository contains a simple Java program for calculating Grade Point Average (GPA). The program allows users to dynamically input their course name, course code, course unit, and scores. Subsequently, the program calculates the GPA, displays the result on the console, and presents the entered courses and values in a tabular form.
